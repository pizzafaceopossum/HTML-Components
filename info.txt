Todo
- Add system of variables/attributes for components.
- Method of indicating where child HTML/components should be placed
- Style classes
- Export resulting HTML
- Importing HTML and replacing swapping in known components
- System where components themselves have defined attributes that are inherited (like normal HTML does) as well as a way for modified attributes on instances to trickle down
	- cAttributeInherit tag: Indicates that the contained HTML elements should inherit attribute changes made in an instance
		(i.e., <component cID="button" style="background-color: red"></component> => <button style="background-color: red">)
	The tag can be given a list of attributes and style attributes to inherit, or a keyword like "all"
	-
